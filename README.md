### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This theme was made with the AMOLED dark mode in mind. You must enable it for the theme to display properly
In order to turn on AMOLED dark mode, in your Aliucord app navigate to ``Settings -> Appearance`` and rapidly tap the 'Dark' setting. A new setting should appear below it called "AMOLED optimised mode", you must switch this on.
You will see a warning about having this setting on when going into your Themer settings, you can ignore this as it is necessary for this theme.
